    <h1>About The Way</h1>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting! The Way is a one person development shop that delivers software solutions
      for you business needs. I specialize in web development but appreciate the opportunity to learn new
      technology. After graduating from a bootcamp in 2013, I spent a year churning out websites for an
      agency based in Boulder, CO. It was here that I started to appreciate UI/UX design and development 
      and began to hone skills in building interactive and beatiful User Interfaces.

      I learned a lot at that job and knew that I liked building beautiful sites, but also knew I wanted more. 
      After that year, I started contracting at a small company based in Denver, CO which provided me to 
      work as a full stack developer and grow into a more well-rounded developer. I greatly enjoy working on 
      this small team and learn a lot every day, but that same curiosity and desire for growth has led me here, 
      to seek new client work.
